Write a program that combines two lists by alternatingly taking elements, e.g. [a,b,c], [1,2,3] â†’ [a,1,b,2,c,3]. The program should be able to handle lists of different lengths.

Input:
- `n1` the number of elements in the first list
- n1 numbers representing the list
- `n2` the number of elements in the second list
- n2 numbers represting the list

Output:
The result combined list

Example 1:
Input:
3
1
2
3
3
4
5
6

Output:
[1,4,2,5,3,6]

Example 2:
Input:
2
2
4
4
1
1
