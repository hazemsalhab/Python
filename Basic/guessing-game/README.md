Write a guessing game where the user has to guess a secret number. After every guess the program tells the user whether their number was higher or lower. At the end the number of tries needed should be printed.

Hint: you can use the following code to generate a random number less than 100 in python

```
import random
n = random.randint(1, 100)
```
